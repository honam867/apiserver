Taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin and located between the sirloin and rib, hand-cut and hand-trimmed by the El Gaucho butchers, the filet steak is a feast for the eye and the mouth. The Castello D’Albola Chianti Classico DOCG 2011 from Tuscany pairs nicely with a filet. It is firm and taut, with a core of cherry and berry flavors, accented by underbrush tobacco and iron notes, balanced with a mineral aftertaste. Perfect for dishes of the traditional Chianti cuisine, as well as for grilled meats and mature cheeses.",

      "description": "Brut Réserve Taittinger is one of the last great Champagne Houses to remain independent and is owned and actively managed by the family named on the label. The family are guardians of Taittinger’s style quality and integrity. The hallmark of their fine Champagnes is the high proportion of Chardonnay used in their winemaking which is key, in the Champagne region, for producing wines of great elegance and finesse. Additionally, with its vineyard ownership of 288 ha (one of the largest in Champagne}, Taittinger can guarantee a flawless signature, and wines heralded worldwide for their consistent quality. Our signature cuvée, Taittinger Brut Réserve, is assembled from more than 35 crus and incorporates 40% Chardonnay – this high level is seldom offered in a non-vintage Champagne. Distinguished by a delicate nose marked by subtle brioche notes, it has a palate of considerable depth and balance with hints of honey and fresh fruit with a long, fresh finish.",

So, over 170 years ago, Joseph Krug broke with convention to follow his vision. To create the most generous expression of Champagne every year, regardless of climatic unpredictability.Joseph’s bold experiment proved a triumph and he succeeded in creating Champagne like never before. And like no other Champagne House since. To this day, the House of Krug lives and breathes his enduring philosophy, creating only prestige Champagnes since 1843.

Flavours of hazelnut, nougat, barley sugar, jellied and citrus fruits, almonds, brioche and honey.Krug Grande Cuvée lends itself to a plethora of culinary combinations, from the simplest to the most sophisticated, from an extra mature parmesan to a dish of turbot à la truffle.",

Additionally, with its vineyard ownership of 288 ha (one of the largest in Champagne}, Taittinger can guarantee a flawless signature, and wines heralded worldwide for their consistent quality. Our signature cuvée, Taittinger Brut Réserve, is assembled from more than 35 crus and incorporates 40% Chardonnay – this high level is seldom offered in a non-vintage Champagne.

The family are guardians of Taittinger’s style quality and integrity. The hallmark of their fine Champagnes is the high proportion of Chardonnay used in their winemaking which is key, in the Champagne region, for producing wines of great elegance and finesse. Additionally, with its vineyard ownership of 288 ha (one of the largest in Champagne}, Taittinger can guarantee a flawless signature, and wines heralded worldwide for their consistent quality. Our signature cuvée, Taittinger Brut Réserve, is assembled from more than 35 crus and incorporates 40% Chardonnay – this high level is seldom offered in a non-vintage Champagne. Distinguished by a delicate nose marked by subtle brioche notes, it has a palate of considerable depth and balance with hints of honey and fresh fruit with a long, fresh finish.",
